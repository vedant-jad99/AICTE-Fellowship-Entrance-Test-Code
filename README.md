# AICTE-Fellowship-Entrance-Test-Code
AICTE alongwith pupilfirst organization is conducting CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship programme. This repo contains the task given for the shortlisting of candidates. The task was to build a command line programming to manage todo tasks. Options were given to code in several languages, like `C++, Python, Java, Javascript, etc.` They had provided the starter package, and we had to fill in the respective files.
In this repository, I have provided the completed code for C++ as well as Python. I am including the readme of both the packages over here
